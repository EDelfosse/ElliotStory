Once there was a man named John. John lived in a mining town.
One day John was at a 711 and was approached by a miner and was asked to buy alcohol.
John went in the 711 and purchased some beer for the miner.
Johnny was later arrested because the miner was actually a minor.
However, after talking to the policeman John discovered that the minor
he was buying alcohol for, heavily resembled the policeman. After talking to 
him more he discovered that in fact his suspicions were correct. It was the policeman's son.
